I always wonder why people care so much about their ages -- it's unchangeable and unstoppable, which seems really meaningless to talk about it. I have been thinking about it for a really long time, until recently I gradually understand it.

Time is defined by people. I reminisce at the age of me going primary school, when I thought about growing up was just graduating from here, and not knowing that there are middle school, high school and university waiting for me. It's so long and too enduring to think about future for a 10 years old little boy. I don't think about where I came from and where will I go. Everything was just really simple. Then I started to continue on all the educations from schools just like all other kids. I never thought about what I should do when I actually "grow up" until high school. I remember that year my grandma's sister dead, and I remember the last dinner we had together. Oh, that's really heart-broking… As a result, I decided to become a physician. Yet you know how hard is it to be a doctor, but I believed I had a lot of time to learn, and I am not worry about it. Until one day, all the dreams were shattered when I came to university. I'm new to this area (biology), and I realized I actually don't like it. Then I changed my major from biology to electrical engineer, and then computer engineer, and finally computer scienc — trying to find out my worthiness. Thinking about all these today, I found it's strange that I made all the important decision during a short period in university. I guess it's because I start to realize I am having a competition with time at the age of 18, but not just myself anymore.

So now I turned 25. It's a wonderful age, and it's another milestone to me. I got my first actual job from a foreign country, and I got a decent pay. My girlfriend also got into PhD program in the area she liked the most. It all happened so fast, and I am not even sure if I am ready. I started enjoying comtemplating while showering, and I feel a sense of emptiness for not doing anything while I am alive. I want to keep myself busy. I find a man's life is so short, and you can count it down to how many years to live. Am I getting too worried?

25 marks as a ending for my childhood, and also marks as a begining for me taking more responsibility. I am still exploring, and I am so happy about it. I still have the energy and motivation to do what I want, but I also know a haste pivot won't work so well in the future. Overall, it feels good to be 25 :)
