I always wonder why people care so much about their ages -- it's unchangeable and unstoppable, which seems really meaningless to talk about it. I have been wondering about this for a really long time, until recently I gradually understand it.

Time is defined by people. I reminisce at the age of me going primary school, when I thought about growing up was just graduating from here, and not knowing that there are middle school, high school and university waiting for me. It's so long and too enduring to think about future for a 10 years old little boy. I don't think about where I came from and where will I go. Everything was just really simple. Then I started to continue on all the educations from schools just like all other kids. I never thought about what I should do when I actually "grow up" until high school. I remember that year my grandma's sister dead, and I remember the last dinner we had together. Oh, that's really heart-broking... So I decided to become a physician. You know how hard is it to be a doctor, but I believed I had a lot of time to learn to be a doctor. All the dream is shattered when I came to university. I'm new to this area, and I realized I actually don't like it. Then I changed my major from biology to electrical engineer, and then computer engineer, and finally computer science. It's strange that I made all the important decision during a short period in university. I guess it's because I realize I am having a competition with time, but not myself anymore.

So now I turned 25. It's a wonderful age, and it's another milestone to me. I got my first actual job from foreign country, and I got decent pay. My girlfriend also got into PhD program in the area she liked the most. It all happened so fast, and I am not even sure if I am ready. 25 marks as a ending for my childhood, and also marks as a begining for me taking more responsibility. I am still exploring, and I am so happy about it. I still have the energy and motivation to do what I want, but I also know a haste pivot won't work so well in the future.
