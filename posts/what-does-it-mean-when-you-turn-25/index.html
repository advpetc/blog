I have been thinking about it for a really long time, until recently I gradually understand it.</p><p>Time is defined by people. I reminisce at the age of me going primary school, when I thought about growing up was just graduating from here, and not knowing that there are middle school, high school and university waiting for me. It&rsquo;s so long and too enduring to think about future for a 10 years old little boy. I don&rsquo;t think about where I came from and where will I go. Everything was just really simple. Then I started to continue on all the educations from schools just like all other kids. I never thought about what I should do when I actually &ldquo;grow up&rdquo; until high school. I remember that year my grandma&rsquo;s sister dead, and I remember the last dinner we had together. Oh, that&rsquo;s really heart-broking… As a result, I decided to become a physician. Yet you know how hard is it to be a doctor, but I believed I had a lot of time to learn, and I am not worry about it. Until one day, all the dreams were shattered when I came to university. I&rsquo;m new to this area (biology), and I realized I actually don&rsquo;t like it. Then I changed my major from biology to electrical engineer, and then computer engineer, and finally computer scienc — trying to find out my worthiness. Thinking about all these today, I found it&rsquo;s strange that I made all the important decision during a short period in university. I guess it&rsquo;s because I start to realize I am having a competition with time at the age of 18, but not just myself anymore.</p><p>So now I turned 25. It&rsquo;s a wonderful age, and it&rsquo;s another milestone to me. I got my first actual job from a foreign country, and I got a decent pay. My girlfriend also got into PhD program in the area she likes the most. It all happened so fast, and I am not even sure if I am ready. I start enjoying comtemplating while showering, and I feel a sense of emptiness for not doing anything while I am alive. I want to keep myself busy. I find a man&rsquo;s life is so short, and you can count it down to how many years to live. Am I getting too worried?</p><p>25 marks as a ending for my childhood, and also marks as a begining for me taking more responsibility. I am still exploring, and I am so happy about it. I still have the energy and motivation to do what I want, but I also know a haste pivot won&rsquo;t work so well in the future. Overall, it feels good to be 25 :)</p></div></article></main><div><a class=prev href=https://blog.peterchen.xyz/posts/how-do-i-create-this-site/ title="How Do I Create This Site">« How Do I Create This Site</a>
