<a href=/tags/growth>growth</a><div><p>I always wonder why people care so much about their ages &ndash; it&rsquo;s unchangeable and unstoppable, which seems really meaningless to talk about it. I have been thinking about it for a really long time, until recently I gradually understand it.</p><p>Time is defined by people. I reminisce at the age of me going primary school, when I thought about growing up was just graduating from here, and not knowing that there are middle school, high school and university waiting for me. It&rsquo;s so long and too enduring to think about future for a 10 years old little boy. I don&rsquo;t think about where I came from and where will I go. Everything was just really simple. Then I started to continue on all the educations from schools just like all other kids. I never thought about what I should do when I actually &ldquo;grow up&rdquo; until high school. I remember that year my grandma&rsquo;s sister dead, and I remember the last dinner we had together. Oh, that&rsquo;s really heart-broking… As a result, I decided to become a physician. Yet you know how hard is it to be a doctor, but I believed I had a lot of time to learn, and I am not worry about it. Until one day, all the dreams were shattered when I came to university. I&rsquo;m new to this area (biology), and I realized I actually don&rsquo;t like it. Then I changed my major from biology to electrical engineer, and then computer engineer, and finally computer scienc — trying to find out my worthiness. Thinking about all these today, I found it&rsquo;s strange that I made all the important decision during a short period in university. I guess it&rsquo;s because I start to realize I am having a competition with time at the age of 18, but not just myself anymore.</p><p>So now I turned 25. It&rsquo;s a wonderful age, and it&rsquo;s another milestone to me. I got my first actual job from a foreign country, and I got a decent pay. My girlfriend also got into PhD program in the area she liked the most. It all happened so fast, and I am not even sure if I am ready. I started enjoying comtemplating while showering, and I feel a sense of emptiness for not doing anything while I am alive. I want to keep myself busy. I find a man&rsquo;s life is so short, and you can count it down to how many years to live. Am I getting too worried?</p><p>25 marks as a ending for my childhood, and also marks as a begining for me taking more responsibility. I am still exploring, and I am so happy about it. I still have the energy and motivation to do what I want, but I also know a haste pivot won&rsquo;t work so well in the future. Overall, it feels good to be 25 :)</p></div></article></main><aside><div><div><h3>LATEST POSTS</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href=/posts/%E5%85%B3%E9%97%AD%E6%9C%8B%E5%8F%8B%E5%9C%88/>关闭朋友圈</a></li><li><a href=/posts/how-to-talk/>How to Talk</a></li><li><a href=/posts/why-doordash-cannot-deliver-your-order-properly/>Why DoorDash Cannot Deliver Your Order Properly</a></li><li><a href=/posts/create-responsive-shortcode/>Create Responsive Shortcode</a></li><li><a href=/posts/what-does-it-mean-when-you-turn-25/>What Does It Mean When You Turn 25</a></li></ul></div></div></aside><footer><p>&copy; 2021 <a href=https://blog.peterchen.xyz/><b>颢阳</b></a>.
