He is very busy on his research works, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t really expect too much from this course (it&amp;rsquo;s only 1.5 credit), so we agreed on meeting once per two weeks.
Send everything using email isn&amp;rsquo;t bad at all, it&amp;rsquo;s even more efficient In order to provide some help in case he was busy, he delegated an PhD student named Samrat supervised by him.</description></item></channel></rss>
